# Vocabify

A Chrome Extension to help improve your vocabulary.

## How does it work?

Once installed, you'll see an extension icon in the top right of your browser.

Now, as you're browsing the internet you may come across a new word you're not familiar with. Here's how to add it to your vocabulary -

1. Highlighting the word in the browser
2. Click on the Vocabify extension to open the popup UI
3. Click on the "copy word" button to copy the highlighted word into the popup

Now you need to go find a definition for the word, so do a quick search for the word and find a definition you like the most. The definition should be no more than 400 characters in length. Then repeat _nearly_ the same steps.

1. Highlight the definition in the browser
2. Click on the Vocabify extension to open the popup UI
3. Click on the "copy definition" button to copy the definition into the popup

Now you've got a word and defintion that you want to add to your vocabulary you can click the "Save to Vocabify" button. The popup UI will then reset.

You can view the words saved to your vocabulary by clicking the "Launch Vocabify" button in the popup which will launch Vocabify in a new tab and list out all your saved words and definitions.
