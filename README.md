# Vocabify

A Chrome Extension to help improve your vocabulary.

## How does Vocabify work?

Once installed you'll see the Vocabify extension icon in the top right of your browser.

As you're browsing the internet you'll likely come across new words you're not familiar with. Here's how to Vocabify them (i.e. add them to your vocabulary!) -

1. Highlight the word in the browser
2. Click on the Vocabify extension to open the popup
3. Click on the "copy word" button in the popup to copy the highlighted word into the popup

Now go find a definition for the word, so do a quick search for the word and find a definition you like the most. The definition should be no more than 400 characters in length. Then repeat _nearly_ the same steps again.

1. Highlight the definition in the browser
2. Click on the Vocabify extension to open the popup
3. Click on the "copy definition" button in the popup to copy the definition into the popup

You can click into the word or definition in the popup and add it / edit it manually too.

Now you've got a word and defintion to add to your vocabulary so click the "Save to Vocabify" button. They'll be saved and the popup UI will then reset back to its default state.

You can view your saved words by clicking the "Launch Vocabify" button in the popup which will launch Vocabify in a new tab and list out all your saved words and definitions.
